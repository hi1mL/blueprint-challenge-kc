`````markdown
I've read `AGENTS.md` and started `AI_USAGE.md` with this turn logged. No application code was written.

## Files

**Root:** `AGENTS.md` (AI-logging rules), `AI_USAGE.md` (new log), `README.md` (challenge spec), `docker-compose.yml` (Postgres + backend + frontend), `.github/workflows/tests.yml` (CI grading), `.dockerignore`, `.gitignore`

**backend/** — `app.py`, `database.py`, `db_models.py`, `models.py`, `requirements.txt`, `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml` (backend+db only), `tests/test_routes.py`. `__pycache__/*.pyc` files are also committed; they're just build leftovers.

**frontend/** — Vite + React 19 + TypeScript. `src/App.tsx`, `src/api/api.ts`, `src/types.ts`, `src/components/{BookList,BookForm,BookDetail,CheckoutForm}.tsx`, tests (`App.test.tsx`, `api/api.test.ts`, `components/components.test.tsx`), plus Jest, ESLint, TS and Vite config.

**scripts/** — `check_readiness.py` (CI gate), `smoke-test.sh` (curl checks against running containers).

## What the starter code does

It's a LibraryConnect catalog app. Staff can add books, search and filter them, and record checkouts. The structure is all in place, but the parts that actually do the work are stubbed out with TODOs.

### Backend (FastAPI + SQLAlchemy)
- **`models.py`**: Pydantic schemas that already enforce validation: the `BookGenre` enum (6 values), `EmailStr` for the publisher email, and `date` for the checkout date. This is what produces 422 on bad input.
- **`db_models.py`**: `Book` and `Checkout` ORM tables. `Checkout.book_id` is a foreign key to `books.id`, and the relationship cascades.
- **`database.py`**: builds the engine from `DATABASE_URL` (falls back to SQLite) and provides the `get_db()` session dependency.
- **`app.py`**: CORS is set up for `localhost:5173` and there's a working `GET /` healthcheck. All 5 endpoints (`POST/GET /books`, `GET /books/{id}`, `POST /checkouts`, `GET /books/{id}/checkouts`) currently `raise HTTPException(501, "TODO…")`. Two gaps to note: nothing injects `get_db`, and nothing calls `Base.metadata.create_all`, so tables would never get created against real Postgres. The tests create their own tables.

### Frontend (React)
- **Components**: fully rendered and presentational (props in, callbacks out). They have labeled inputs, a genre filter, a "View Details" button, a checkout history list, and the forms. Their remaining TODOs are optional UX work: validation, empty state, submit confirmation, and prefilling the book.
- **`api/api.ts`**: all 5 functions `throw new Error("TODO…")`. The base URL is hardcoded to `http://localhost:8000`.
- **`App.tsx`**: holds the state (books, selected book, checkouts, filters, both forms). Every handler is stubbed with `setError("TODO…")`. Because the form `onChange` handlers are stubs, typing in a form doesn't do anything yet.

### Tests and grading
- **Backend tests** (in-memory SQLite, override `get_db`): check 422 validation, create/list/get, search plus genre filter (`q=career&genre=Reference` → 1 result, case-insensitive), 404 for a missing book on `GET /books/{id}`, `POST /checkouts`, and `GET /books/{id}/checkouts`, and that the checkout list only includes the requested book. Create endpoints may return 200 or 201.
- **Frontend tests**: check the exact fetch contract (inactive filters like `''`/`'All'` are left out of the query, special characters are URL-encoded, POSTs send a JSON content-type). `App.test.tsx` mocks the API and drives the full UI: filtering, creating a book that then appears in the list, viewing details and history, and creating a checkout that shows up next to existing history.
- **CI**: `check_readiness.py` skips grading while any executable `TODO: implement` stub remains in `app.py`, `App.tsx`, or `api.ts`. Once those are gone, it runs pytest (Py 3.12) and Jest (Node 22). The README says not to modify the tests or the workflow, and to keep the component props, labels, and headings as they are.

To pass, the work is: implement the 5 backend routes (with DB wiring and table creation), the 5 API functions, and the 6 `App.tsx` handlers. Let me know when you want to start.

#### Assistance and code contribution
- Appended this Turn 2 entry to `AI_USAGE.md` (logging only).
- Ran `git status --short` and `git diff --stat HEAD -- README.md`. README.md and all
  other tracked files were unchanged since Turn 1; the only untracked file was `AI_USAGE.md`.
  Relied on the full README/source/test contents read in Turn 1 rather than re-reading them.
- Planning only: produced an ordered build plan (backend DB wiring → book routes →
  checkout routes → frontend API layer → App.tsx state/handlers → UX TODOs → end-to-end
  verification and submission). No application code written or modified.
- No applicant edits observed.

#### Verification
Not run (no tests or builds executed; planning only).

#### Assistant response — verbatim
`````markdown
I read `README.md` in full last turn. `git status` shows it and every other tracked file are unchanged since then; the only new file is `AI_USAGE.md`, where this turn is logged. No code written.

## Files (unchanged from last turn)

- **Root:** `README.md` (challenge spec), `AGENTS.md`, `AI_USAGE.md`, `docker-compose.yml`, `.github/workflows/tests.yml`, `.gitignore`, `.dockerignore`
- **backend/:** `app.py` (routes), `models.py` (Pydantic schemas), `db_models.py` (SQLAlchemy tables), `database.py` (engine/session), `requirements.txt`, `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, `tests/test_routes.py`
- **frontend/src/:** `App.tsx` (state + handlers), `api/api.ts` (fetch calls), `types.ts`, `components/` (`BookList`, `BookForm`, `BookDetail`, `CheckoutForm`), plus three test files
- **scripts/:** `check_readiness.py` (CI grading gate), `smoke-test.sh`

## What the starter code does

The challenge asks for an internal tool where library staff manage a book catalog (create, list, view details), search by title and filter by genre, and record and view checkouts per book. The stack is React, FastAPI, and PostgreSQL.

The starter gives you the scaffolding, and everything that actually does work is a stub:
- **Done already:** Pydantic validation (genre enum, email, date → automatic 422s), the ORM tables `Book`/`Checkout` with a foreign key, the DB engine and `get_db()`, CORS, the healthcheck, all four UI components (labels, headings, and callbacks the tests depend on), types, Docker setup, and tests.
- **Stubbed:** all 5 backend routes return 501, all 5 `api.ts` functions throw, and all 6 `App.tsx` handlers only set a TODO error. Tables are also never created, and routes aren't wired to a DB session.
- **Grading:** CI skips grading until those `TODO: implement` stub lines are gone, then requires pytest and Jest to both pass. Tests and workflow must stay unchanged.

## Build order

**1. Backend foundation** (`backend/app.py`)
- Create tables at startup (`Base.metadata.create_all`, ideally in a lifespan hook).
- Inject `db: Session = Depends(get_db)` into the routes. The tests override `get_db`, so this is required.

**2. Book endpoints**
- `POST /books`: save the book and return it with its `id` (201).
- `GET /books/{id}`: return the book, or 404.
- `GET /books?q=&genre=`: case-insensitive title match (`ilike`) plus an optional genre filter.
- ✅ Checkpoint: the book tests in `pytest backend/tests` pass.

**3. Checkout endpoints**
- `POST /checkouts`: 404 if the book doesn't exist, otherwise save it and return it.
- `GET /books/{id}/checkouts`: 404 if the book doesn't exist, otherwise that book's checkouts only.
- ✅ Checkpoint: all 12 backend tests pass.

**4. Frontend API layer** (`frontend/src/api/api.ts`)
- A small fetch helper that throws on `!response.ok`.
- `listBooks` should build the query with `URLSearchParams` and leave out an empty `q` and `genre === 'All'`.
- POSTs send `Content-Type: application/json`.
- ✅ Checkpoint: `api.test.ts` passes.

**5. App wiring** (`frontend/src/App.tsx`), one handler at a time:
1. The form `onChange` handlers: just set state. Nothing else works until these do.
2. `handleLoadBooks`: load on mount and whenever search or genre changes, which makes the "Load Books" button optional.
3. `handleSelectBook`: fetch the book and its checkouts, and prefill the checkout form's `book_id`.
4. `handleCreateBook`: create the book, add it to the list or refetch, and reset the form.
5. `handleCreateCheckout`: create the checkout, refresh history if it's for the selected book, and reset the form.
6. Clear or show errors properly.
- ✅ Checkpoint: all Jest tests pass. `check_readiness.py` should report `ready=true`.

**6. UX polish** (the non-blocking TODOs): required-field validation, an empty-state message, submit feedback and confirmation, and removing the "Integration TODO" card and placeholder text. Some light styling so non-technical staff find it clear.

**7. End-to-end and submission**
- Run `docker compose up --build` and `./scripts/smoke-test.sh`, then click through the real app against Postgres.
- Push, confirm the CI **Grade** shows PASS, and open a PR titled `[Your Name] - …`.
- Add the submission summary to `AI_USAGE.md`.

Steps 1–3 and 4 are independent, so the frontend API layer could come first if you prefer. I'd do the backend first so the real app can be tried as soon as the frontend is wired up. Ready to start step 1 when you are.

### Turn 3 — 2026-09-26T14:56:45-07:00
Tool/assistant: Claude Code (Claude desktop app, Code tab)
Model: claude-opus-5-5 (Claude Opus 5.5)
Model identity source: runtime metadata
Capture: Live
Status: Completed

#### User prompt — verbatim
````text
Build only step 1 for now
````

#### Assistance and code contribution
- Inspected `.gitignore`, `backend/Dockerfile` (runs `uvicorn app:app` from `backend/`, so
  the non-relative import fallback must keep working), and the Python environment.
  FastAPI was not installed globally (`ModuleNotFoundError`), so I created a throwaway venv
  in the session scratchpad (outside the repo) and installed `backend/requirements.txt` there.
- **Modified existing code, `backend/app.py`** (all additions were generated by the assistant):
  - Imports: `Depends`, `sqlalchemy.orm.Session`, `AsyncIterator`, `asynccontextmanager`,
    `db_models` (so the tables register on `Base.metadata`), and `Base, engine, get_db`
    from `database`. Both the relative and absolute import branches were updated.
  - New `lifespan()` context manager that calls `Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)`
    on startup, passed to `FastAPI(..., lifespan=lifespan)`.
  - Added a `db: Session = Depends(get_db)` parameter to `create_book`, `list_books`,
    `get_book`, `create_checkout`, and `list_book_checkouts`, with `_ = db` placeholders.
    The existing 501 stub bodies and TODOs are left as they were for steps 2–3.
- No other files changed. No applicant edits observed.

#### Verification
- Executed: `DATABASE_URL='sqlite:///:memory:' python -m pytest -q backend/tests` (scratchpad
  venv, Python 3.14.7). Result: **5 passed, 7 failed**. The passes are the five 422-validation
  tests. The failures are all routes that still return 501 (expected until steps 2–3).
- Executed: a startup check against a fresh SQLite file in the scratchpad. Tables before
  startup: `[]`. After `TestClient` startup: `['books', 'checkouts']`. `GET /` → 200
  `{'status': 'ok'}`, and invalid `POST /books` → 422.
- Not run: Postgres/Docker, frontend tests.

#### Assistant response — verbatim
`````markdown
Step 1 is done. The only file changed is `backend/app.py`.

**What changed**
- **Table creation:** a new `lifespan` hook runs `Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)` when the app starts. It imports `db_models` so both tables are registered, and it only creates tables that are missing, so restarts are safe.
- **DB session injection:** all 5 routes now take `db: Session = Depends(get_db)`. The tests override `get_db` with their in-memory database, so this is what connects the routes to the test DB.
- The route bodies are still the original 501 stubs, which steps 2–3 will replace. I updated both import branches (relative for pytest's `backend.app`, absolute for Docker's `uvicorn app:app`).

**Verification**

FastAPI wasn't installed on your machine, so I made a throwaway venv in my scratchpad (not in the repo) to test with.
- `pytest backend/tests`: **5 passed, 7 failed.** The 5 validation (422) tests pass. The 7 failures are the routes that still return 501, which is expected until steps 2–3.
- Startup check on a fresh DB: no tables before, `books` and `checkouts` after startup. `GET /` returns 200.
- Not tested yet against Postgres/Docker. That's planned for step 7.

**One thing to know:** if you run pytest locally without setting `DATABASE_URL`, startup will create a `libraryconnect.db` SQLite file in your current directory, and `.gitignore` doesn't exclude it. CI sets `sqlite:///:memory:`, so it isn't affected. Locally you can run:

```bash
DATABASE_URL='sqlite:///:memory:' python -m pytest -q backend/tests
```

Ready for step 2 (book endpoints) when you are.

`````markdown
None of the README's features yet. Step 1 was backend groundwork that all the features depend on, not a feature a staff member can use.

It did two things in `backend/app.py`:

1. **The database tables get created.** When the backend starts, it now creates the `books` and `checkouts` tables if they're missing. Before this, nothing ever created them, so the first save would have failed.
2. **The API routes can reach the database.** Each of the 5 endpoints now receives a database session. The route bodies still return "501 not implemented", so they don't use it yet.

From a user's point of view nothing changes yet: you still can't create, list, or check out books. The first real feature, **Book Management** (create a book, list books, view one book), comes in step 2. **Search and Filtering** is also part of step 2, on the `GET /books` endpoint.

#### Assistance and code contribution
- Explanation only, comparing the README's features with the Turn 2 build plan. Added
  a step-by-feature mapping table and offered a feature-by-feature (vertical slice)
  ordering as an alternative. No files read or modified other than this log. No

#### Verification

#### Assistant response — verbatim
`````markdown
**Features** describe what staff can do. The README lists three: Book Management, Search and Filtering, and Checkout Tracking. **Steps** are the order I proposed for writing the code, and they're split by *layer* (backend → frontend API calls → screen), not by feature.

That means each feature is spread across several steps, and most steps contain pieces of more than one feature:

| Step | Book Management | Search & Filtering | Checkout Tracking |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Backend foundation (tables + DB session) | shared groundwork | shared groundwork | shared groundwork |
| 2. Book endpoints | ✅ create / list / get one | ✅ `q` + `genre` on list | — |
| 3. Checkout endpoints | — | — | ✅ create / list per book |
| 4. Frontend API calls (`api.ts`) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| 5. App wiring (`App.tsx`) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| 6. UX polish | ✅ | ✅ (empty state) | ✅ |
| 7. End-to-end + submit | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

So a feature is only usable by staff once it's done in steps 2/3, 4 **and** 5. For example, Book Management needs the backend route, the `api.ts` call, and the `App.tsx` handler.

**Why I ordered it by layer:** the starter code and tests are organized that way (backend tests, API tests, App tests), so each step ends with a test checkpoint you can run. Each layer is also built on the one below it.

**The alternative is building by feature ("vertical slices"):** do Book Management through all layers, then Search, then Checkouts. The upside is that each feature works in the real app sooner. The downside is going back into the same files (`app.py`, `api.ts`, `App.tsx`) three times, and CI still won't grade anything until all the stubs are gone. Either works. Tell me if you'd rather switch.

````

#### Assistance and code contribution
- Checked the environment: `docker` was not found on PATH, and `py -0` showed only Python 3.14
  (64-bit). Listed `backend/`.
- Wrote a PowerShell walkthrough for running the backend locally on SQLite (a venv in
  `backend/.venv`, uvicorn, `/` and `/docs` checks, a table check, and pytest). No code
  written or modified. No applicant edits observed.

#### Verification
- None of the walkthrough commands were run in this turn. Equivalent checks were run in
  Turn 3 (pytest: 5 passed / 7 failed; lifespan created `books` and `checkouts` tables).
  The exact PowerShell commands are suggested for the applicant and not executed by me.

#### Assistant response — verbatim
`````markdown
Docker isn't installed on this machine (`docker` isn't found), so the simplest way is to run the backend directly with Python. It will use a local SQLite file instead of Postgres. The frontend isn't useful yet because every button still shows a TODO, so we'll only run the backend.

Commands are for **PowerShell**, starting from the repo folder (`blueprint-challenge-kc`).

### 1. Set up a Python environment (one time)

```powershell
cd backend
```

```powershell
py -m venv .venv
```

```powershell
.venv\Scripts\python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

I call `.venv\Scripts\python` directly so you don't have to activate the venv. That avoids PowerShell's script-execution-policy error.

### 2. Start the backend

```powershell
.venv\Scripts\python -m uvicorn app:app --reload
```

Wait for `Application startup complete.` Leave this terminal running.

### 3. Check what step 1 did

**a. Server is up.** Open http://localhost:8000/ in a browser. You should see `{"status":"ok"}`.

**b. Tables were created at startup.** This is the main thing step 1 added. A `libraryconnect.db` file should now exist in `backend/`. In a **second** terminal, from `backend/`:

```powershell
.venv\Scripts\python -c "import sqlite3; print(sqlite3.connect('libraryconnect.db').execute('select name from sqlite_master').fetchall())"
```

You should see `books` and `checkouts` in the output, along with some `ix_...` index names. For extra proof: stop the server (Ctrl+C), delete `libraryconnect.db`, start it again, and the file and tables come back.

**c. Routes are wired up.** Open http://localhost:8000/docs. All 5 endpoints are listed. Click **POST /books → Try it out**:
- Send `"genre": "Mystery"` or a bad email → **422**. Validation is working.
- Send a valid book → **501 "TODO: implement POST /books"**. That's expected until step 2.

### 4. (Optional) Run the backend tests

From the repo root, in a second terminal:

```powershell
$env:DATABASE_URL = 'sqlite:///:memory:'
```

```powershell
backend\.venv\Scripts\python -m pytest -q backend/tests
```

Expected result: **5 passed, 7 failed**. The 7 failures are the 501 stubs, which steps 2–3 will fix.

### Cleanup notes
- `backend/.venv/` and `backend/libraryconnect.db` aren't in `.gitignore`, so don't commit them. I can add them to `.gitignore` if you want.
- To test against real Postgres (as the README intends), install Docker Desktop and run `docker compose up --build` from the repo root. I'd leave that for step 7.

````text
for the "check what step 1 did" step, do i paste that entire command, even the stuff before the quotation marks
````

#### Assistance and code contribution
- Explained the parts of the table-check command. No repo code written or modified.
- Copied the Turn 3 scratchpad test DB to `libraryconnect.db` in the scratchpad (outside
  the repo) so the exact command could be tested there. No applicant edits observed.

#### Verification
- Executed in PowerShell 5.1 (from the scratchpad, using the scratchpad venv's python):
  `venv\Scripts\python -c "import sqlite3; print(sqlite3.connect('libraryconnect.db').execute('select name from sqlite_master').fetchall())"`
  Output: `[('books',), ('ix_books_title',), ('ix_books_id',), ('ix_books_genre',), ('checkouts',), ('ix_checkouts_book_id',), ('ix_checkouts_id',)]`.
  This confirms the quoting works in PowerShell. It was not run against the applicant's
  `backend/libraryconnect.db`.

#### Assistant response — verbatim
`````markdown
Yes, paste the **whole line**, including everything before the quotes. It's one command:

```powershell
.venv\Scripts\python -c "import sqlite3; print(sqlite3.connect('libraryconnect.db').execute('select name from sqlite_master').fetchall())"
```

What each part does:
- `.venv\Scripts\python` runs the Python inside your venv. This part is required. Without it, PowerShell doesn't know what to run the rest with.
- `-c` tells Python "run the following code".
- `"…"` is the short Python snippet itself. It opens `libraryconnect.db` and prints the names of everything inside it.

Two things to check before running it:
1. You're in the `backend` folder, since that's where `.venv` and `libraryconnect.db` are. If your prompt doesn't end in `\backend>`, run `cd backend` first.
2. The server from step 2 has been started at least once, because that's what creates `libraryconnect.db`.

I ran this exact line in PowerShell on a copy of my test database, and it printed:

```text
[('books',), ('ix_books_title',), ('ix_books_id',), ('ix_books_genre',), ('checkouts',), ('ix_checkouts_book_id',), ('ix_checkouts_id',)]
```

If you see `books` and `checkouts` in yours, step 1 is working. The `ix_…` entries are indexes and can be ignored. If you get `[]`, the file exists but the server hasn't created the tables. Let me know if that happens.

**Step 1, simply put:**

Think of the database as a filing cabinet.

1. **It builds the drawers.** When the backend starts, it checks that there's a "books" drawer and a "checkouts" drawer, and creates them if they're missing.
2. **It gives each endpoint a key to the cabinet.** Every request to the backend (for example "add a book" or "list books") is now handed a database connection it can use.

Nothing is put in or taken out of the cabinet yet. The endpoints have the key but still just say "not implemented."

**How it connects to step 2:** step 2 uses that key. The book endpoints will put books into the drawer and read them back out (including searching and filtering).

#### Assistance and code contribution
Blocked: this turn was interrupted by a safeguard flag (request ID
`req_011CfT5unjUgsQ2DvkJMHkgk`). Before the safeguard stopped it, this turn modified
`backend/app.py` to implement the step 2 book endpoints (source: applicant, stated in
Turn 12). The changes present in the file afterwards were `_book_response`,
`create_book` (POST /books), `list_books` (GET /books with `q` and `genre`), `get_book`
(GET /books/{id}), a `from sqlalchemy import select` import, and removal of two
`# noqa: F401` comments. These were observed and reviewed in Turn 10. The turn's full
output, including its tool calls, any other actions, and its response, cannot be

Read AGENTS.md and follow its logging rules. The last entry in AI_USAGE.md was interrupted by a safeguard flag (request ID req_011CfT5unjUgsQ2DvkJMHkgk) before any work was done. Mark it Blocked with a note, then implement build step 2: the book endpoints (POST /books, GET /books with q and genre filters, GET /books/{id}). Give me a short summary of what changed.
````

#### Assistance and code contribution
- Marked Turn 9 `Blocked` with a note about the safeguard interruption (request ID
  `req_011CfT5unjUgsQ2DvkJMHkgk`), per the applicant's request.
- Read `backend/app.py`, `backend/models.py`, `backend/db_models.py`,
  `backend/database.py`, `backend/tests/test_routes.py`, and the README endpoint table.
- **Observed pre-existing edits (authorship not determined by the assistant):** at the start
  of this turn, `backend/app.py` already had uncommitted changes (shown as modified in
  `git status` before the turn began) implementing all three book endpoints:
  `_book_response` helper, `create_book` (POST /books, 201), `list_books` (GET /books with
  case-insensitive title search `q` and exact `genre` filter), `get_book`
  (GET /books/{id}, 404 if missing), plus a `from sqlalchemy import select` import and
  removal of two `# noqa: F401` comments. The Turn 9 entry records no work, so the assistant
  cannot attribute these edits; the applicant should confirm who wrote them.
  **Correction (Turn 12):** the applicant has since confirmed that these edits were made by
  Claude Code in the interrupted Turn 9. Turn 9 now records this.
- The assistant reviewed this code and did not modify it, since it already met the
  requirements. No application code was generated or modified by the assistant this turn.

#### Verification
- Executed `backend/.venv/Scripts/python -m pytest -q backend/tests`: 8 passed, 4 failed.
  All 4 failures are checkout tests (`test_create_checkout_success`,
  `test_create_checkout_returns_404_for_missing_book`,
  `test_list_book_checkouts_returns_only_requested_book`,
  `test_list_book_checkouts_returns_404_for_missing_book`), which fail with 501 because
  step 3 is not implemented yet. All book tests passed.
- Executed an ad-hoc TestClient script against a throwaway SQLite DB in the scratchpad
  (not the applicant's `libraryconnect.db`): POST returned 201 with an id; `q=%` matched
  only the title containing a literal `%`; `q=""` returned all books; `q=PURE` matched
  case-insensitively; `genre=Other` filtered correctly; `genre=Mystery` returned 422;
  `GET /books/1` returned the book; `GET /books/abc` returned 422.

#### Assistant response — verbatim
`````markdown
I marked Turn 9 as **Blocked** in `AI_USAGE.md` and noted the safeguard request ID. This turn is logged as Turn 10.

**One thing to check first:** step 2 was already written before I started. `backend/app.py` had uncommitted changes that implement all three book endpoints. My logged turns don't include writing them, so I didn't overwrite anything. I reviewed and tested the code instead, and logged it as "observed edits, author not determined." If you wrote it, or it came from another tool, please note that in the log.

**What's in `backend/app.py` now:**
- **`POST /books`** saves the book and returns it with its new `id` (status 201).
- **`GET /books`** lists books in id order.
  - `q` does a case-insensitive "title contains" search. Characters like `%` and `_` are matched literally.
  - `genre` filters by exact genre. An invalid genre returns 422.
- **`GET /books/{id}`** returns the book, or 404 `"Book not found"` if it doesn't exist.
- There's also a small helper, `_book_response`, and a new `select` import.

**Verification:**
- `pytest backend/tests`: 8 passed, 4 failed. All 4 failures are the checkout tests, which still return 501 because that's step 3. Every book test passes.
- I also tested edge cases on a throwaway database (not your `libraryconnect.db`): literal `%` search, empty `q`, mixed case, genre filter, bad genre, and non-numeric id. All behaved correctly.

Nothing has been committed. Next up is step 3, the checkout endpoints.

  steps 3–7. No application files were read or modified. No new applicant edits observed.

#### Verification
Not run (question only).

#### Assistant response — verbatim
`````markdown
Yes. They come from the build plan I gave you in Turn 2. I re-checked it in `AI_USAGE.md` rather than relying on memory. Nothing else was changed.

**3. Checkout endpoints**
- `POST /checkouts` and `GET /books/{id}/checkouts`, both returning 404 if the book doesn't exist.
- Checkpoint: all 12 backend tests pass.

**4. Frontend API layer** (`frontend/src/api/api.ts`)
- A fetch helper that throws on errors.
- `listBooks` builds the query string and skips an empty `q` and `genre === 'All'`.
- POSTs send JSON.
- Checkpoint: `api.test.ts` passes.

**5. App wiring** (`frontend/src/App.tsx`), one handler at a time:
- the form `onChange` handlers
- load books
- select a book (plus its checkouts)
- create a book
- create a checkout
- error handling

Checkpoint: all Jest tests pass and `check_readiness.py` reports `ready=true`.

**6. UX polish**
- Required-field validation, an empty-state message, and submit feedback.
- Remove the "Integration TODO" card and placeholder text, and add light styling.

**7. End-to-end and submission**
- `docker compose up --build` plus `smoke-test.sh` against Postgres.
- Push and confirm the CI Grade shows PASS, then open the PR.
- Add the submission summary to `AI_USAGE.md`.

Steps 1–3 (backend) and step 4 (frontend API) don't depend on each other. Step 5 needs both done first.

`````markdown
I've updated the Blocked entry (Turn 9) in `AI_USAGE.md`:

- **What it says now:** the interrupted turn modified `backend/app.py` to add the step 2 book endpoints before the safeguard stopped it. It names the specific changes and says your statement in this turn is the source. It also says the turn's full output can't be recovered. That covers its tool calls, its checks, and its response, so there may be work the entry doesn't capture. The Verification and Response sections now say the same thing.
- **Corrections, not rewrites:** the log rules say to append corrections instead of quietly rewriting history. So Turn 9 keeps a labeled correction note that quotes the wrong wording it replaced: "before any work was done," "no code was written," and "redone in Turn 10."
- **Turn 10:** I added a one-line correction there too. It had said the author of the `app.py` edits wasn't known, and it now points to Turn 9.

No code was changed.

  testing instructions based on it. No application files were read or modified. No new
  applicant edits observed.

#### Verification
Not run this turn. The expected pytest result (8 passed, 4 failed) comes from the
Turn 10 run. The /docs steps are suggested checks and were not executed this turn.

#### Assistant response — verbatim
`````markdown
The easiest place is FastAPI's built-in test page at **http://localhost:8000/docs**. It's the same page you used for step 1. The frontend won't help yet, because its buttons aren't wired up until step 5.

### 1. Start the backend
In PowerShell, from the `backend` folder:

```powershell
.venv\Scripts\python -m uvicorn app:app --reload
```

Wait for `Application startup complete.` If the server is already running from before, `--reload` has picked up the step 2 code automatically.

### 2. Try the book endpoints at http://localhost:8000/docs
On each endpoint, click **Try it out**, then **Execute**.

1. **POST /books**: paste this in and execute. You should get **201**, and the response should include an `id`.
   ```json
   {
     "title": "Career Skills Handbook",
     "genre": "Reference",
     "description": "Guide to job readiness",
     "author": "Career Services Staff",
     "publisher_email": "careers@example.org",
     "shelf_location": "REF-CSH-001"
   }
   ```
   Add a second book with a different title and genre so the filters have something to filter.
2. **GET /books**
   - Leave both fields blank to get all books.
   - Set `q` to `career` (any capitalization) to get only matching titles.
   - Pick a `genre` to get only that genre. Try `q` and `genre` together too.
3. **GET /books/{book_id}**: use an `id` from step 1 to get that book. Try `999` to get **404 "Book not found"**.

The books are saved in `backend/libraryconnect.db`, so they're still there after a restart.

### 3. (Optional) Run the tests
From the repo root:

```powershell
backend\.venv\Scripts\python -m pytest -q backend/tests
```

Expected: **8 passed, 4 failed**. The 4 failures are the checkout tests, which step 3 will fix.

#### Assistance and code contribution
- Question only. Explained the pytest warning based on the warnings summary from the
  assistant's own Turn 10 test run (Starlette test client `DeprecationWarning` about
  `anyio.abc.BlockingPortal`). The applicant's own output was not seen; they were told how
  to confirm it is the same warning. No files read or modified other than this log. No new
  applicant edits observed.

#### Verification
Not run this turn. The warning text is from the Turn 10 pytest run. The applicant reported
8 passed, 4 failed, 1 warning from their own run, which matches the Turn 10 result.

#### Assistant response — verbatim
`````markdown
That's almost certainly the same warning I got when I ran the tests. It isn't about your code.

```text
starlette\testclient.py:45: DeprecationWarning: The anyio.abc.BlockingPortal alias is deprecated, use anyio.from_thread.BlockingPortal instead.
```

**What it means:** Starlette is the library FastAPI's test client is built on. Its test client uses a name from another library, `anyio`, that newer versions of anyio have marked as "will be removed someday." Your installed anyio is newer than what that Starlette version expects, so it prints a heads-up.

**Does it matter?** No. It comes from inside `.venv`, not from `app.py` or the tests. The tests still run normally, and it won't affect grading. It would go away if Starlette and FastAPI were upgraded, but that's not worth doing for this challenge.

To confirm yours is the same one, scroll up in the test output to the `warnings summary` section. It should mention `starlette\testclient.py` and `BlockingPortal`. If it says something different, paste it here.

````

#### Assistance and code contribution
- Question only. Explained how `list_books` in `backend/app.py` matches titles (reviewed,
  not modified). No files modified other than this log. No new applicant edits observed.

#### Verification
- Executed a script with the backend venv that compiled the `icontains(..., autoescape=True)`
  filter to SQL for both dialects. SQLite:
  `lower(books.title) LIKE '%' || lower('50/%/_off') || '%' ESCAPE '/'`. PostgreSQL:
  `books.title ILIKE '%%' || '50/%%/_off' || '%%' ESCAPE '/'` (`%%` is the driver's
  escaping of `%`). No database was queried.
- The example table in the response is based on the code's logic and was not executed.
  The Turn 10 ad-hoc run did confirm case-insensitive matching and a literal `%` match.

#### Assistant response — verbatim
`````markdown
The search is a **case-insensitive "title contains this text"** match. It's this line in `list_books` in `backend/app.py`:

```python
query = query.where(db_models.Book.title.icontains(q, autoescape=True))
```

**In plain terms:** a book matches if the text you typed appears anywhere in its title, whatever the capitalization.

| `q` | "Career Skills Handbook" matches? |
|---|---|
| `career` | yes (start of title) |
| `SKILLS` | yes (middle, different case) |
| `book` | yes (inside a word, "Hand**book**") |
| `skills career` | no (words must appear together, in that order) |
| `carer` | no (no typo tolerance) |

**What happens under the hood:** SQLAlchemy turns it into SQL. I compiled it to check:
- **SQLite** (your local run): `lower(title) LIKE '%' || lower(q) || '%'`. Both sides are lowercased, and the `%` wildcards on each end mean "anything before or after."
- **Postgres** (Docker/CI): `title ILIKE '%' || q || '%'`. `ILIKE` is Postgres's built-in case-insensitive `LIKE`.

**Details worth knowing:**
- **`autoescape=True`:** in SQL `LIKE`, `%` and `_` are wildcards. Autoescape makes them count as plain characters, so searching `100%` finds titles containing "100%" instead of matching everything.
- **Blank search is ignored:** `if q:` skips the filter when `q` is empty or missing, so you get all books.
- **Only the title is searched.** Author and description aren't, which matches the README's "search by title."
- **Spaces aren't trimmed:** `" career"` (with a leading space) wouldn't match a title that starts with "Career."
- **It combines with genre:** if both are given, a book must match both (AND).
- Results are always sorted by `id`.

If you want, a small improvement would be to trim spaces (`q.strip()`). It's optional, and nothing requires it.

    implementations of `create_checkout` (POST /checkouts, now `status_code=201`, 404 for a
    missing book) and `list_book_checkouts` (GET /books/{id}/checkouts, 404 for a missing
    book, filtered by `book_id`, ordered by id). These replace the starter 501 stubs.
  - **Modified existing code:** `get_book` (written in Turn 9) now calls `_get_book_or_404`
    instead of its own inline lookup. Behavior is unchanged.
- No applicant edits to application code observed since Turn 17.

#### Verification

  `2026-01-12`; the book's checkouts list returned only its checkout; a book with no

Step 3 is done. The only code file changed is `backend/app.py`.

**What changed:**
- **`POST /checkouts`** returns 404 "Book not found" if the book doesn't exist. Otherwise it saves the checkout and returns it with its new `id` (201).
- **`GET /books/{id}/checkouts`** returns 404 if the book doesn't exist. Otherwise it returns only that book's checkouts, in the order they were created. A book with no checkouts gives `[]`.
- **New helper `_get_book_or_404`:** all three places that need "find the book or return 404" now share it. That includes `GET /books/{id}` from step 2, which I shortened to use it. It behaves the same as before.
- **New helper `_checkout_response`,** matching the `_book_response` helper from step 2.

**Verification:**
- `pytest backend/tests`: **12 passed**, plus the same harmless Starlette warning. This is the step 3 checkpoint.
- I also checked edge cases on a throwaway database: a book with no checkouts gives `[]`, a bad date or missing field gives 422, a missing book gives 404 on both endpoints, and dates come back as `2026-01-12`.

To try it yourself, go to http://localhost:8000/docs and use **POST /checkouts** with a real `book_id`, then **GET /books/{book_id}/checkouts**. Nothing has been committed. The backend is now complete. Step 4 is the frontend API layer.

1. **Get a book id.** Run **GET /books** and note an `id`. If the list is empty, create a book with **POST /books** first.
2. **POST /checkouts** with that id. You should get **201**, and the response should include a checkout `id`.
   ```json

   }
   ```
3. **GET /books/{book_id}/checkouts** with the same id. Your checkout should be in the list.
4. **Check the error cases:**
   - Run **POST /checkouts** with `"book_id": 999999`. You should get **404 "Book not found"**.
   - Run **GET /books/999999/checkouts**. You should get **404**.
   - Run **POST /checkouts** with `"date": "tomorrow"`. You should get **422**, because the date must be `YYYY-MM-DD`.
   - Run **GET /books/{id}/checkouts** on a book that has no checkouts. You should get `[]`.

### 3. Run the tests
Open a second PowerShell window. From the repo root (`blueprint-challenge-kc`), run:

```powershell

You should see **12 passed, 1 warning**. That's the same harmless Starlette warning as before.

#### Assistance and code contribution
- Question only. Compared `create_book` and `create_checkout` in `backend/app.py` and the
  `BookCreate`/`CheckoutCreate` models in `backend/models.py`, from code already read this
  session (reviewed, not modified). No files modified other than this log. No new applicant

#### Verification
Not run (question only). The behaviors described were exercised in the Turn 10 and Turn 18 runs.

#### Assistant response — verbatim
`````markdown
They follow the same pattern: validate the input, save a row, and return it with a new `id` (201). The differences are in what they store and what they check.

| | `POST /books` | `POST /checkouts` |
|---|---|---|
| **What it records** | A book in the catalog | One patron borrowing one book |
| **Saved to** | `books` table | `checkouts` table |
| **Fields** | title, genre, description, author, publisher_email, shelf_location | patron_name, book_id, date, notes |
| **Automatic validation (422)** | genre must be one of the 6 allowed values, email must be valid, all fields required | date must be `YYYY-MM-DD`, book_id must be a number, all fields required |
| **Extra check** | none | **The book must exist**, or it returns 404 "Book not found" |
| **Depends on** | nothing | an existing book |

**The key difference is the book check.** A checkout points at a book through `book_id`, so `create_checkout` first calls `_get_book_or_404`. That stops a checkout from being saved for a book that isn't in the catalog. `create_book` has nothing to look up, so it saves straight away.

**One small technical difference:** books are saved with `model_dump(mode="json")`, which turns the genre into plain text like `"Fiction"` for the database. Checkouts use the default `model_dump()`, which keeps `date` as a real date for the database's date column.

#### Assistance and code contribution
- Question only. Searched `README.md` for the checkout requirements and ran an ad-hoc check.
  No application code modified. No new applicant edits observed.

#### Verification
- Executed an ad-hoc TestClient script against a throwaway SQLite DB in the scratchpad:
  created one book and three checkouts for it (Ana 2026-01-10, Ben 2026-01-10,
  Ana 2026-01-11). All three returned 201, and GET /books/1/checkouts listed all three.

#### Assistant response — verbatim
`````markdown
Yes. Any number of patrons can check out the same book, and the same patron can check it out more than once. Each checkout is saved as its own row with its own `id`.

I tested it on a throwaway database. Three checkouts of one book all returned 201, and the book's history listed all three:

```text
(1, 'Ana', '2026-01-10')
(2, 'Ben', '2026-01-10')   <- same day, different patron
(3, 'Ana', '2026-01-11')   <- same patron again
```

**Why:** the only rule is "the book must exist." There's no check for whether the book is already checked out, and no "returned" tracking. The README treats checkouts as a **history log** ("record checkouts", "view checkouts associated with a book"), not as a live loan status, so this matches the spec.

One note on "same title": checkouts are linked by **book `id`**, not by title. If two separate book records happen to share a title, each one has its own checkout history.

#### Assistance and code contribution
- Question only. Answered from `backend/db_models.py` and `backend/models.py`, already read
  this session (reviewed, not modified). Pointed out that `patron_name` has a 255-character
  column limit (`String(255)`) that the Pydantic model does not validate. No files modified
  other than this log. No new applicant edits observed.

#### Verification
Not run. The Postgres integer ceiling and the 500 error for over-length names are based on
the column types and known database behavior. They were not tested, because Postgres is not
available locally (Docker not installed, per Turn 6).

#### Assistant response — verbatim
`````markdown
Right, the app sets no limit. Patrons aren't stored as their own records. Each checkout just holds a `patron_name` as text, so there's nothing to cap.

The only real limits come from the database, and you won't hit them:
- **Checkout ids:** the `id` column is a regular integer. On Postgres that tops out around **2.1 billion** checkouts.
- **Disk space**, in practice.

Two related things, just so you know:
- **Name length:** `patron_name` is a `String(255)` column, but the API doesn't check length. On Postgres, a name over 255 characters would cause a server error (500) instead of a clean 422. SQLite doesn't enforce the limit, so you won't see it locally. It's unlikely with real names, and it could be tightened later if you want.
- **No paging:** `GET /books/{id}/checkouts` returns every checkout for the book at once. That's fine at library scale.

#### Assistance and code contribution
- **Modified existing code** in `backend/app.py`, `list_books` (written in Turn 9): added
  `q = q.strip() if q else q` so leading and trailing spaces are ignored and a search of
  only spaces is treated as no search.
- **Modified existing starter code** in `backend/models.py`, `CheckoutCreate`: changed
  `patron_name: str` to `patron_name: str = Field(max_length=255)` with a one-line comment,
  and added `Field` to the pydantic import.
- Searched the frontend for `patron_name` usage (reviewed only). The frontend, tests, and
  other fields were left unchanged per the applicant's instruction.
- **Observed applicant action:** `git log` shows a new commit `824bd00 book endpoints done`
  (step 2) that was not made by the assistant. The Edit tool also reported that
  `backend/app.py` had changed on disk since the assistant last read it with that tool. The
  full `git diff HEAD` showed only the assistant's Turn 18 step 3 changes plus this turn's
  edits, and no other content changes.

#### Verification
- Executed `git diff HEAD -- backend/app.py backend/models.py`: diff limited to step 3
  (Turn 18) and this turn's changes.
- Executed `backend/.venv/Scripts/python -m pytest -q backend/tests`: 12 passed, 1 warning.
- Executed an ad-hoc TestClient script against a throwaway SQLite DB in the scratchpad:
  `q="  career  "` returned `['Career Skills']`, `q="   "` returned both books,
  `q="career"` returned `['Career Skills']`, a 255-character patron_name returned 201, a
  256-character name returned 422 "String should have at most 255 characters", and a normal
  checkout returned 201.
- Not run: frontend tests, Postgres.

#### Assistant response — verbatim
`````markdown
Both improvements are in. Each is a one-line code change, and nothing else was touched.

**1. Search trims spaces** (`list_books` in `backend/app.py`)
```python
q = q.strip() if q else q
```
Now `"  career  "` finds "Career Skills", and a search of only spaces is treated like a blank search, so it shows all books.

**2. Patron name length check** (`CheckoutCreate` in `backend/models.py`)
```python
patron_name: str = Field(max_length=255)
```
A name over 255 characters now gets a clean **422** ("String should have at most 255 characters") instead of a possible database error on Postgres. I also added the `Field` import and a one-line comment.

**Left alone on purpose:** the other text fields, the frontend, the tests, and the rest of the endpoint code. I checked the full diff, and it contains only the step 3 work and these two changes. The diff also shows you've committed step 2 ("book endpoints done").

**Verification:**
- `pytest backend/tests`: **12 passed**, 1 warning (the same Starlette one).
- Checked on a throwaway database:
  - `"  career  "` returns 1 match.
  - `"   "` returns all books.
  - A 255-character name returns 201, and a 256-character name returns 422.
  - A normal checkout still returns 201.

Nothing is committed yet.

#### Assistant response — verbatim
`````markdown
Step 4 is written, but **I couldn't run the tests.** Node.js isn't installed on this machine (`node` and `npm` aren't found), so Jest can't run here. The only file changed is `frontend/src/api/api.ts`.

**What changed:** the five `TODO` stubs now call the backend.
- **Shared helpers:**
  - `request` sends the call and throws an error if the response isn't OK.
  - `postJson` sends JSON with `Content-Type: application/json`.
  - `errorMessage` turns FastAPI errors into readable text: `"Book not found"`, or the validation messages for a 422.
- **`listBooks`** builds the query with `URLSearchParams`. It leaves out an empty `q` and `genre: "All"`, and special characters like `C++ & books? #1` are encoded safely.
- **`getBook`**, **`listBookCheckouts`**: plain GET calls.
- **`createBook`**, **`createCheckout`**: POST calls. `createCheckout` converts the form's `book_id` from text to a number.

The backend and other frontend files are unchanged. The app still won't work in the browser until step 5 wires these into `App.tsx`.

**Verification:** Not run. I checked the code by hand against all 8 tests in `api.test.ts` and the strict TypeScript settings, but a real test run is the only proof.

**To run the tests yourself:**
1. Install Node.js LTS from https://nodejs.org. Then open a **new** PowerShell window so it picks up `node`.
2. From the `frontend` folder:

```powershell
npm ci
```

```powershell
npx jest src/api/api.test.ts
```

You should see **8 passed**. Don't run the full `npm test` yet. The `App` and component tests are expected to fail until step 5. If any of the 8 fail, paste the output here.

No. There's no command for installing Node.js in my last message. Step 1 is just a link: **you** download the installer from the official site and run it like any other Windows program. I didn't install anything, and I won't install system software on your machine.

To be clear about the steps:
- **Step 1 (you, in a browser):** go to https://nodejs.org, download the **LTS** Windows installer (`.msi`), and run it with the default options.
- **Steps 2–3 (the two code blocks):** these are ordinary project commands, and they only work after Node is installed. `npm ci` installs the frontend's packages listed in `frontend/package-lock.json` into `frontend/node_modules`, and it only affects that folder. `npx jest ...` runs the tests.

Always check that a download comes from the official `nodejs.org` site. Installing Node is optional for now. I can keep writing step 5 without it, but none of the frontend code can be tested until it's installed.

#### Assistance and code contribution
- Diagnosed the error as PowerShell's execution policy blocking `npm.ps1`. No files modified
  other than this log. Nothing was installed or reconfigured.
- Read the app's terminal panel. It showed only a fresh PowerShell prompt, so the
  applicant's error output was not visible to the assistant.
- Observed that Node.js is now installed at the default Program Files location (install
  performed by the applicant, not the assistant).

#### Verification
- Executed `Get-ExecutionPolicy -List`: every scope was Undefined except `Process = Bypass`
  (the assistant's own session). Undefined machine-wide means the Windows default
  (Restricted) applies in the applicant's normal PowerShell windows.
- Executed a PowerShell check: `npm` is not on the assistant session's PATH, and
  `npm.cmd` exists in the Node.js install folder (True).
- The suggested `npm.cmd ci` / `npx.cmd jest` commands were not executed by the assistant,
  to avoid running at the same time as the applicant's own install.

#### Assistant response — verbatim
`````markdown
That's PowerShell's script-blocking rule, not a problem with Node or the project. Typing `npm` in PowerShell runs a small script file, `npm.ps1`, and Windows blocks scripts by default. Your machine uses that default. Node itself installed fine: I can see it in `C:\Program Files\nodejs`.

**Fix: add `.cmd` to the commands.** This runs the regular Windows version of npm, which isn't blocked. Nothing about your security settings changes. From the `frontend` folder:

```powershell
npm.cmd ci
```

```powershell
npx.cmd jest src/api/api.test.ts
```

You should see **8 passed**. If `npm.cmd` isn't found either, close PowerShell and open a new window, since windows opened before the install don't know where Node is.

Another option is to allow scripts for your user account with `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser RemoteSigned`. That changes a Windows security setting, so it's your call. The `.cmd` approach works without it.

9 is correct. My count of 8 was wrong. One of the tests, "listBooks omits inactive filters," is written once but runs **3 times** with different inputs (`undefined`, `{}`, and `{q: "", genre: "All"}`). So 8 tests in the file become 9 test runs. Sorry for the confusion.

Now that Node is installed, I ran the checks myself too:
- `jest src/api/api.test.ts`: **9 passed**. That matches your run.
- TypeScript type check (`tsc`): no errors.
- ESLint on `api.ts`: no problems.

#### Verification
Not run this turn. The Jest result (9 passed) comes from Turn 28. The browser-console check
is a suggested check and was not executed by the assistant.

#### Assistant response — verbatim
`````markdown
There are two ways to test it.

### 1. The automated tests (you've already done this)
From `frontend`:

```powershell
npx.cmd jest src/api/api.test.ts
```

9 passed means step 4 meets its checkpoint. These tests use a **fake** backend, though, so they only prove the functions send the right requests.

### 2. Try it against the real backend (optional)
The app's buttons aren't connected until step 5. You can still call the functions directly from the browser console.

1. **Start the backend** in one PowerShell window, from `backend`:
   ```powershell
   .venv\Scripts\python -m uvicorn app:app --reload
   ```
2. **Start the frontend** in a second window, from `frontend`:
   ```powershell
   npm.cmd run dev
   ```
3. Open **http://localhost:5173**. The page will still show "TODO" messages, which is expected.
4. Open the browser console (**F12**, then the **Console** tab) and paste these lines one at a time:
   ```js
   const api = await import('/src/api/api.ts')
   ```
   ```js
   await api.listBooks()
   ```
   ```js
   await api.listBooks({ q: 'career', genre: 'All' })
   ```
   ```js
   await api.getBook(999999)
   ```

What you should see:
- The first `listBooks` returns the books in your database.
- The search returns only matching titles.
- `getBook(999999)` shows a red error: **"Book not found"**. That means the error handling works.

If Chrome shows a warning about pasting, type `allow pasting` and press Enter first. I haven't run this browser check myself; I only ran the automated tests.

- **F12** opens DevTools. The first time, Edge may ask "Do you want to open DevTools?" Click **Open**.
- Right-click the page, choose **Inspect**, then click the **Console** tab.

**Finding the Console tab:** it's in the row of tabs at the top of the DevTools panel. If you don't see it, click the **>>** (or **+**) button in that row and choose **Console**. You may also see a "Welcome" tab the first time; you can close it.

**Typing commands:** click the area at the bottom of the Console next to the `>` prompt, paste a line, and press Enter. Edge may also show a warning about pasting. If so, type `allow pasting` and press Enter, then paste again.

#### Assistant response — verbatim
`````markdown
**Step 4 gave the frontend a way to talk to the backend.** It's the "phone line" between them.

Before step 4, every function in `frontend/src/api/api.ts` just threw a "TODO" error. Now each one calls a real backend endpoint:

| Function | Calls | Used for |
|---|---|---|
| `listBooks` | `GET /books?q=&genre=` | the catalog list, search, and genre filter |
| `getBook` | `GET /books/{id}` | showing one book's details |
| `createBook` | `POST /books` | the "add a book" form |
| `listBookCheckouts` | `GET /books/{id}/checkouts` | a book's checkout history |
| `createCheckout` | `POST /checkouts` | the "record a checkout" form |

**Handled for you inside these functions:**
- An empty search, or genre "All", isn't sent, so you get all books.
- Special characters in a search (`&`, `?`, `#`) are sent safely.
- Form data is sent as JSON, and the checkout's `book_id` is converted from text to a number.
- Backend errors become readable messages like "Book not found" instead of silent failures.

**What it didn't do yet:** the app's screen doesn't use these functions, so the buttons still show TODO messages. Step 5 connects them in `App.tsx`.

**Proof:** 9/9 API tests pass (you and I both ran them), plus no TypeScript or lint errors. The only file changed was `frontend/src/api/api.ts`.

#### Assistance and code contribution
- Question only. Confirmed by searching `frontend/src/api/api.ts` that `postJson` sets
  `Content-Type: application/json`, and explained its purpose. No application files
  modified. No new applicant edits observed.

#### Verification
- Executed `grep` on `frontend/src/api/api.ts`: the header is set on line 41.
- Executed an ad-hoc TestClient script against a throwaway SQLite DB in the scratchpad,
  posting the same book JSON string to POST /books: with `Content-Type: application/json`
  it returned 201; with `text/plain;charset=UTF-8` it returned 422 "Input should be a valid
  dictionary or object to extract fields from".
- The CORS preflight behavior was described, not tested in a browser.

#### Assistant response — verbatim
`````markdown
**Yes.** Both POSTs (`createBook` and `createCheckout`) go through the `postJson` helper in `api.ts`, which sets it:

```ts
headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
body: JSON.stringify(payload),
```

The `api.test.ts` tests also check for this header on both POSTs, and they pass.

**What it does:** it's a label on the request that tells the backend what format the body is in.
- `JSON.stringify(payload)` turns the form data into a JSON **text string**.
- On its own, `fetch` labels a string body as `text/plain`, meaning "just some text."
- The `application/json` label tells FastAPI "this text is JSON, parse it into fields." FastAPI then checks it against `BookCreate` or `CheckoutCreate`.

**Why it matters:** I tested the same book data against the backend with both labels:

| Content-Type | Result |
|---|---|
| `application/json` | **201**, book created |
| `text/plain` (fetch's default) | **422** "Input should be a valid dictionary or object…", because FastAPI doesn't read it as JSON |

So without the header, every "add book" or "record checkout" would fail even with valid data.

**A side effect, already handled:** because the frontend (port 5173) and backend (port 8000) are different origins, a JSON request makes the browser send a quick "is this allowed?" check first. The backend's CORS settings in `app.py` already allow it, so nothing extra is needed.

why does data have to travel as text and not as an object
````

#### Assistance and code contribution
- Question only (conceptual explanation of serialization). No files read or modified other
  than this log. No new applicant edits observed.

#### Verification
Not run (question only).

#### Assistant response — verbatim
`````markdown
Because a network can only carry **bytes**: a flat sequence of 1s and 0s. A JavaScript object isn't a sequence of bytes. It lives in the browser's memory.

**Why the object itself can't be sent:**
- A JS object is scattered pieces in the browser's memory, linked by memory addresses. Those addresses mean nothing on another computer, or even in another program.
- The backend is **Python**, which stores data in a completely different way. Even if you could copy the browser's memory over, Python couldn't read it.

**So both sides agree on a shared format:**
1. **Frontend:** `JSON.stringify(payload)` flattens the object into text such as `{"title":"Dune","genre":"Fiction",...}`. This is called **serializing**.
2. **Network:** that text travels as bytes.
3. **Backend:** FastAPI reads the text and rebuilds it as a Python object (`BookCreate`). This is **deserializing**.

The response makes the same trip back the other way. That's what `response.json()` in `api.ts` does: it turns the backend's text back into a JS object.

**Why JSON specifically:** almost every language can read and write it, and people can read it too. That's why you can see it in the `/docs` page or the browser's Network tab. Strictly speaking, the data only has to be bytes, not text. Some systems use compact binary formats instead, but JSON is the standard choice for web APIs like this one.

**How this ties back to your last question:** the `Content-Type: application/json` header tells the backend which format those bytes are in, so it knows how to rebuild the object.

No. Step 4 is complete. I just re-checked: no `TODO`s are left in `api.ts`, and the API tests still pass (**9/9**).

The only loose end is that **it isn't committed yet**. Commit `frontend/src/api/api.ts` and `AI_USAGE.md`. `node_modules` is already ignored by git, so it won't sneak in.

````

#### Assistance and code contribution
- Read `frontend/src/App.tsx`, `frontend/src/App.test.tsx`, `frontend/src/components/*.tsx`,
  and `scripts/check_readiness.py` (reviewed only).
- `frontend/src/App.tsx`:
  - **Generated:** replacements for the six starter handler stubs (`handleLoadBooks`,
    `handleSelectBook`, `handleBookFormChange`, `handleCheckoutFormChange`,
    `handleCreateBook`, `handleCreateCheckout`); a new `errorText` helper; a `useEffect`
    that loads books on mount and when `search`, `genreFilter`, or the new `booksVersion`
    state changes, ignoring stale responses; and a `latestSelectedId` ref that guards
    View Details against out-of-order responses.
  - **Modified starter code:** the React import (added `useEffect`, `useRef`) and a new
    import of the five API functions. The JSX, the "Integration TODO" card, and the header
    text were left unchanged (planned for step 6).
  - One follow-up edit this turn: removed `async` from `handleLoadBooks`.
- **Observed applicant action:** `git log` shows a new commit `4fad9a7 frontend api layer`
  (step 4), not made by the assistant. The backend (port 8000) and the Vite dev server
  (port 5173) were already running, started by the applicant.

#### Verification
- Executed from `frontend/` (Node from the default Program Files install):
  `npx.cmd tsc -p tsconfig.app.json --noEmit` and `npx.cmd tsc -b` exited 0;
  `npx.cmd eslint src/App.tsx` and `npx.cmd eslint .` exited 0; `npx.cmd jest` reported
  3 suites passed and 20 tests passed (first run before the `async` removal, then again
  after it), with no act()/warning lines found by grep.
- Executed `python scripts/check_readiness.py`: `ready=true`.
- Executed `backend/.venv/Scripts/python -m pytest -q backend/tests`: 12 passed, 1 warning.
- Executed `curl` against the applicant's running servers: `GET /` returned
  `{"status":"ok"}`, and the frontend returned 200. `GET /books` returned the applicant's
  two books (read-only).
- Built-in browser pane, http://localhost:5173 (read-only; no create actions, so the
  applicant's database was not changed): the network log showed `GET /books` 200 and both
  books rendered. Setting the search to "career" (form_input) left one book. Clicking View
  Details (via a JavaScript click, because the pane could not draw for a mouse click)
  showed the book's details and checkout "Marcus Webb 2026-01-12", no error message, and
  the checkout form's book select set to "1".
- Not run: create book/checkout through the real UI (avoided writing to the applicant's DB),
  Postgres/Docker.

#### Assistant response — verbatim
`````markdown
Step 5 is done, and the app now works end to end. The only file changed is `frontend/src/App.tsx`.

**What changed:** each `TODO` handler now uses the step 4 API functions.
1. **Form typing:** `handleBookFormChange` and `handleCheckoutFormChange` now save what you type. Before, typing did nothing.
2. **Loading books:** the list loads when the page opens and reloads automatically whenever the search or genre changes. If you type quickly, an older, slower response can't overwrite a newer one. The "Load Books" button still works as a manual refresh.
3. **View Details:** loads the book and its checkout history together, and pre-selects that book in the checkout form.
4. **Create Book:** saves the book, clears the form, and refreshes the list. The new book appears if it matches the current filters.
5. **Create Checkout:** saves the checkout, adds it to the history if that book is open, and resets the form, keeping the selected book.
6. **Errors:** each action clears the old error first. If something fails, you see the backend's message, such as "Book not found".

**Verification:**
- Frontend `jest`: **20/20 passed** (App, component, and API tests).
- `check_readiness.py`: **`ready=true`**, meaning no starter TODO stubs remain.
- `tsc -b` and `eslint .`: no errors.
- Backend `pytest`: still **12 passed**.
- **Real app check:** your backend and frontend were already running, so I opened `localhost:5173` in my browser pane. I only did read-only checks, so nothing was added to your database. The books loaded on open. Searching "career" narrowed the list to one book. View Details showed the book and its checkout (Marcus Webb), with no errors, and the checkout form's Book field was pre-selected.

**Not done yet (step 6):** the "Integration TODO" card, the "(TODO API)" button label, and the placeholder header text are still there. There's also no form validation, no empty-list message, and no success confirmation yet. Nothing has been committed.

#### Assistance and code contribution
- Question only. Wrote a manual UI test walkthrough with sample data for step 5, based on
  the Turn 35 `App.tsx` code. No files read or modified other than this log. No new
  applicant edits observed.

#### Verification
Not run this turn. The walkthrough is a suggested check. The expected outcomes follow
from the code and the Turn 35 tests. The create-book, create-checkout, invalid-email, and
backend-down steps have not been executed in the real UI by the assistant; the exact
wording of the email error and of "Failed to fetch" is expected, not observed.

#### Assistant response — verbatim
`````markdown
Here's a quick walkthrough with sample data. Your backend and frontend are already running, so just open **http://localhost:5173**. Everything you add here is saved to your local `backend/libraryconnect.db`.

### 1. Create a book
In **Create Book**, enter:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Title | `The Hobbit` |
| Genre | `Fiction` |
| Description | `A hobbit goes on an adventure` |
| Author | `J.R.R. Tolkien` |
| Publisher Email | `contact@allenandunwin.org` |
| Shelf Location | `FIC-TOL-001` |

Click **Create Book**. ✅ The form clears, and "The Hobbit" appears in **Books**.

### 2. Search and filter
In **Books**:
- Type `hob` in Search. ✅ Only The Hobbit shows.
- Change Genre to `Reference`. ✅ The list is empty, because The Hobbit is Fiction.
- Clear the search and set Genre back to `All`. ✅ All books are back.

### 3. View details
Click **View Details** on The Hobbit. ✅ The details card shows its author, email, shelf location, and an empty Checkouts list. The checkout form's **Book** field is pre-set to "The Hobbit."

### 4. Record a checkout
In **Create Checkout**, enter:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Patron Name | `Priya Nair` |
| Book | *(already The Hobbit)* |
| Date | `2026-02-15` |
| Notes | `Due back in 3 weeks` |

Click **Create Checkout**. ✅ "Priya Nair" appears under the Hobbit's Checkouts right away. Add a second checkout, for example `Marcus Webb`, to see both listed.

### 5. Check the errors
- In Create Book, enter `not-an-email` as the Publisher Email and fill in the rest. Click **Create Book**. ✅ A red error appears ("value is not a valid email address…"), and the form keeps what you typed.
- Stop the backend (Ctrl+C in its window) and change the search. ✅ A red "Failed to fetch" error appears. Restart the backend and change the search again. ✅ The error clears.

The rough wording of these errors ("Failed to fetch") is something step 6 can make friendlier.

side note about the 'view details' button, i was able to click on it, but there was no respective text or button or outline for it, i just randomly clicked below the title and was shown the details box like you mentioned. is that intentional? ive provided an image of what i see on the search box
````
Attachment: one screenshot (`1.png`), used to show the issue. It shows the Books list
with three rows ("Career Skills Handbook" Reference, "Breaking Bad" Fiction, "The Hobbit"
Fiction), with no visible View Details button and the genre text directly against the title.

#### Assistance and code contribution
- Investigated the invisible "View Details" button. Read `frontend/src/App.css` and
  `frontend/src/index.css` (reviewed only). Cause: `.list button` sets a transparent
  background with no border but inherits `color: #fff` from the global `button` rule, and
  it is `width: 100%`. `.tag` has no CSS rule. Both are starter code (`git log` shows only
  the initial commit touching these files).
- No files modified other than this log. Proposed a CSS-only fix and asked the applicant
  whether to apply it now or in step 6.

#### Verification
- Executed `git log -- frontend/src/App.css frontend/src/index.css`: only `2a48b0f Initial commit`.
- Executed JavaScript in the built-in browser pane at http://localhost:5173 to read the
  computed styles of the first `.list button`: color `rgb(255, 255, 255)`, background
  `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)`, border `none`, width `832.812px`, text "View Details". The `.tag`
  left margin was `0px`.

#### Assistant response — verbatim
`````markdown
No, it isn't intentional. It's a styling bug in the **starter CSS** (`frontend/src/App.css`, unchanged since the initial commit), not in step 5. The button is there. It's just **white text on a white background**.

I checked the button's styles in my browser pane, and this is the cause:
- A general `button` rule makes all buttons dark with **white text**.
- A more specific `.list button` rule then makes list buttons **transparent with no border**, but it never resets the text color.
- Result: a white "View Details" label on a white card. On top of that, the button stretches across the full row width (833px), which is why clicking anywhere under the title worked.

Your screenshot shows a second, related gap: `.tag` (the genre label, and the date on checkouts) has **no CSS at all**, so "Handbook" and "Reference" run together.

**Suggested fix** (CSS only, in `App.css`, no logic changes):
- Give `.list button` a visible style, such as a small outlined button that isn't full width.
- Add a `.tag` style: a small gray label with spacing.
- Lay out each row with the title on the left and the button on the right.

This fits step 6 (UX polish and light styling). Want me to make this fix now, or fold it into step 6?

  this log. No new applicant edits observed. The assistant did not stop or restart any of
  the applicant's servers.

#### Verification
Not run (instructions only). The "Failed to fetch" message is expected browser behavior
and was not observed by the assistant.

#### Assistant response — verbatim
`````markdown
This is part of step 5 in my test walkthrough: checking that errors appear when the backend is down.

### 1. Stop the backend
1. Find the PowerShell window where you ran `uvicorn app:app --reload`. It shows lines like `Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
2. Click inside that window, then press **Ctrl+C**.
3. Wait for the `PS ...\backend>` prompt to come back. The backend is now off.

Leave the **frontend** window (`npm.cmd run dev`) running. Only the backend should stop.

### 2. Change the search text
1. Go to the app at **http://localhost:5173** in Edge.
2. Click the **Search** box in the **Books** section and type any letter, for example `a`.

✅ A red **"Failed to fetch"** message appears near the top of the page, because the app can't reach the backend.

### 3. Turn the backend back on
1. In the backend window, press the **Up arrow** to bring back the last command, or type it again:
   ```powershell
   .venv\Scripts\python -m uvicorn app:app --reload
   ```
2. Wait for `Application startup complete.`
3. Back in the app, change the search again. For example, delete the `a`.

✅ The red error goes away and your books show again. Your data is safe: stopping the backend doesn't delete anything, because books are saved in `libraryconnect.db`.

#### Verification
- Executed a PowerShell check (`Get-NetTCPConnection` + `Win32_Process`): port 8000 is PID
  42340, command `backend\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m uvicorn app:app --reload`, started

  started 12:45:53, with parent `cmd.exe /d /s /c vite`.
- Who typed the command is not observable. The assistant did not start these servers, and
  the timing is consistent with the applicant following the Turn 29 instructions.

#### Assistant response — verbatim
`````markdown
I checked what's actually running. The backend **is** running from that exact command:

```text
backend\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m uvicorn app:app --reload
```

It was started at **12:45 PM today** from a **PowerShell tab in Windows Terminal**, not by me. I haven't started or stopped any servers. The frontend (`vite`) was started about 20 seconds later. The timing fits the step 4 browser-console instructions I gave earlier, which included this command as "start the backend." You may have pasted it then without it standing out.

**To find and stop it:**
1. Open **Windows Terminal** (the window with tabs). It may be minimized in the taskbar.
2. Look through the tabs for one ending in lines like `Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000` or `Application startup complete.` It will probably also show `GET /books` lines from your testing.
3. Click in that tab and press **Ctrl+C**. Leave the other tab (the one showing `VITE ... ready` / `localhost:5173`) running.

If you can't find the tab, tell me and I can stop that backend process for you instead. You'd then start it again with the command above from the `backend` folder.

#### Assistance and code contribution
- Diagnosed why no error appeared: a second, older backend process was still serving port
  8000. No files modified other than this log. No processes were started or stopped. Offered

#### Assistant response — verbatim
`````markdown
Good catch. The app isn't wrong: **a second backend is still running**, so the frontend is still getting answers.

What I found on port 8000:
- The one you stopped (started today at 12:45 in Windows Terminal) is gone.
- **Another backend, started yesterday at 3:17 PM**, is still running. That's from when you first tested step 1. It runs in a separate **Command Prompt** window (black `cmd.exe` window, opened yesterday around 2:09 PM), not in Windows Terminal. It uses the same code and the same database, so the app behaves exactly the same.

Two backends were listening on the same port at once. Windows allowed that, which is why stopping one changed nothing.

**To stop it:**
1. Find the **Command Prompt** window in your taskbar. It may be minimized. It will show `Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000` near the top, and probably lots of `GET /books` lines.
2. Click in it and press **Ctrl+C**.
3. Then change the search in the app. ✅ You should now see the red **"Failed to fetch"** error.

If you can't find that window, I can stop that backend process for you. Just say so. Afterwards, start **one** backend again (in either window) with:

```powershell
.venv\Scripts\python -m uvicorn app:app --reload
```

#### Assistant response — verbatim
`````markdown
Here's the whole trip, from typing to the book appearing in the list.

### 1. Typing into the form (browser)
**`BookForm.tsx` → `App.tsx`**
- Each keystroke calls the input's `onChange`. That calls `update('title', ...)`, which builds a new copy of the form values with that one field changed.
- The copy goes up to `App`'s `handleBookFormChange`, which saves it with `setBookForm`.
- React redraws the form with the new values. So `App` always holds the current form data in `bookForm`.

### 2. Clicking "Create Book" (browser)
**`App.tsx` → `handleCreateBook`**
- The button's `onSubmit` runs `handleCreateBook()`.
- It first clears any old error with `setError(null)`.
- Then it calls `createBook(bookForm)` from the API layer and waits.

### 3. Sending the request (browser → network)
**`api/api.ts` → `createBook` → `postJson` → `request`**
- `JSON.stringify` turns the form data into JSON text.
- `fetch` sends `POST http://localhost:8000/books` with the header `Content-Type: application/json`.
- The page (port 5173) and the backend (port 8000) count as different sites, so the browser first sends a quick **"is this allowed?"** request. The backend's CORS settings say yes, and then the real POST goes out.

### 4. Checking the data (backend)
**`backend/app.py` → `create_book`, `backend/models.py` → `BookCreate`**
- FastAPI reads the JSON and checks it against `BookCreate`:
  - every field is present
  - the genre is one of the 6 allowed values
  - the email looks valid
- If anything fails, it stops here and sends back **422** with the reasons. Your code never runs.
- It also opens a database session for this request (`get_db`).

### 5. Saving it (backend → database)
**`create_book`**
- `db_models.Book(...)` builds a database row from the data.
- `db.add` and `db.commit()` run an `INSERT` into the `books` table.
- `db.refresh` reads the row back, which picks up the new `id` the database assigned.
- The row is converted to `BookResponse` and sent back as JSON with status **201**. The session is closed.

### 6. Handling the reply (browser)
**`api.ts` → `request`**
- If the status is OK, `response.json()` turns the JSON back into a JS object and returns it.
- If not, `errorMessage` pulls out the backend's reason (for example the email error) and throws it as an error.

### 7. Updating the screen (browser)
**`App.tsx` → `handleCreateBook`, then the `useEffect`**
- **On success:**
  - `setBookForm(initialBookForm)` empties the form.
  - `setBooksVersion(v => v + 1)` tells the book-list effect to run again.
  - The effect calls `listBooks` with the current search and genre (`GET /books?...`), then `setBooks` redraws the list.
  - The new book shows up if it matches the current filters.
- **On failure:**
  - The `catch` runs `setError(message)`, and the red error text appears at the top.
  - The form keeps what the person typed, so they can fix it.

**In one line:** form state → click → `createBook` → JSON POST → FastAPI validates → SQLAlchemy inserts → 201 + JSON → form clears → list refetches → new book appears.

One gap for step 6: nothing disables the button while the request is in flight, so a double-click could create the book twice.

- **One small quirk I noticed:** the checkout form's Book dropdown only lists books that match the current search and filter. If you view a book and then filter it out of the list, the dropdown looks blank, even though the checkout would still save to the right book. It's cosmetic. It could be fixed in step 6 by listing all books in that dropdown.
- **Planned for step 6:** the invisible View Details button, double-submit protection, friendlier error wording, form validation, the empty-list message, and removing the TODO card.

````text
okay. move onto step 6.
````

#### Assistance and code contribution
Blocked: the turn was stopped partway through by a safety classifier. The withheld part of
the output cannot be recovered, and tool calls that had not finished did not run.
Before the interruption, the assistant:
- Read `frontend/src/components/components.test.tsx`, `frontend/src/main.tsx`, the README
  requirements, and `frontend/src/App.tsx` (reviewed only).
- **Generated/modified** (starter components), all new props optional:
  - `BookForm.tsx`: required-field and email validation shown after a submit attempt, a
    `<form>` with a submit button, and optional `submitting`, `successMessage`, and
    `errorMessage` props. Two input ids were accidentally renamed and then restored.
  - `CheckoutForm.tsx`: validation (patron name required and up to 255 characters, book and
    date required, notes optional), a `<form>` with a submit button, the same optional
    props, and a tip line.
  - `BookList.tsx`: optional `loading` prop, empty-state messages, and a row class and
    `type="button"`/`secondary` class on View Details.
  - `BookDetail.tsx`: a "No checkouts recorded" message and layout classes.
- **Not done:** `App.tsx` (removing the TODO card, and passing the new props), CSS fixes
  (invisible View Details button, `.tag`), friendlier network errors in `api.ts`, the
  checkout dropdown listing all books, and double-submit wiring. Step 6 is incomplete.

#### Verification
- After the interruption, executed `git status --short`: the four component files and
  `AI_USAGE.md` are modified. `App.tsx`, `App.css`, and `api.ts` are unchanged.
- Executed `npx.cmd tsc -b` (exit 0) and `npx.cmd jest` (20 passed, 20 total) on this
  partial state.

#### Assistant response — verbatim
None recorded. The response was stopped by a safety classifier and cannot be recovered.

````

#### Assistance and code contribution
- Showed the uncommitted changes from the interrupted Turn 43: ran `git diff --stat` and
  `git diff` for `BookList.tsx` and `BookDetail.tsx`, and opened the app's diff pane
  (uncommitted scope, scrolled to `BookForm.tsx`). The `BookForm.tsx`/`CheckoutForm.tsx`
  descriptions are based on the files written in Turn 43. No files modified other than
  this log.

#### Verification
- Executed `git diff --stat -- frontend`: 4 files, 197 insertions, 18 deletions.
- Build and test status cited from the post-interruption check recorded in Turn 43
  (`tsc -b` exit 0, jest 20 passed). Not re-run this turn.

#### Assistant response — verbatim
`````markdown
I've opened the **diff pane** beside the chat. It shows every uncommitted change, starting at `BookForm.tsx`. Here's a guide to what you'll see.

**4 files changed** (197 lines added, 18 removed). All are in `frontend/src/components/`, and `App.tsx`, CSS, `api.ts`, and the backend are untouched.

### `BookForm.tsx` (+97)
- **Validation:** a `validate()` function checks that title, description, author, publisher email, and shelf location aren't blank. It also checks that the email looks like `name@example.org`.
- **When errors show:** only after someone clicks Create Book with a problem. Then they update live as fields are fixed, and a small red message appears under each bad field.
- **Real `<form>`:** the fields are wrapped in a `<form>`, so pressing Enter also submits. `noValidate` turns off the browser's own pop-ups so our messages are used instead.
- **New optional props, not used yet:** `submitting` disables the button and shows "Saving…". `successMessage` and `errorMessage` show a green or red line under the form.
- **Placeholder** added to Shelf Location ("e.g. FIC-TOL-001"). Input ids and the button label are unchanged.

### `CheckoutForm.tsx` (+94)
- The same pattern as `BookForm`: validation, a real `<form>`, and the same three optional props.
- **Required:** patron name (up to 255 characters, matching the backend), book, and date. **Notes stay optional.**
- A tip line: *Click "View Details" on a book to pre-select it here.* There's also a placeholder on Notes.

### `BookList.tsx` (+19)
- **Empty state:** if no books match the filters, it says so and suggests choosing "All". If the catalog is empty, it says to add a book.
- A new optional `loading` prop shows "Loading books…".
- The View Details button got `type="button"` and a `secondary` class, ready for the CSS fix. **It's still invisible until the CSS is updated.**

### `BookDetail.tsx` (+5)
- Shows "No checkouts recorded for this book yet." when the history is empty.
- Adds two class names for styling.

**Status:** the app builds and all 20 tests pass. The new messages and "Saving…" state won't appear in the app until `App.tsx` passes the new props, which is part of the unfinished rest of step 6.

#### Assistance and code contribution
- Declined to continue the remaining step 6 work, because it is the same work that was
  stopped by a safety classifier in Turn 43 and the assistant was instructed not to
  produce that content again. No application files were read or modified. Listed the
  remaining step 6 items (as already stated in Turn 43) for the applicant.

#### Verification
Not run.

Unresolved: `App.tsx` wiring, CSS fixes, a friendlier network error in `api.ts`, and the
checkout dropdown listing all books remain undone.

#### Assistant response — verbatim
`````markdown
I can't continue this part. The rest of step 6 is the same work that was stopped last time, and I've been told not to produce that content again, even written a different way. So I'm leaving the remaining step 6 changes to you.

**Where things stand:**
- The component changes from before the interruption are on disk (you've seen them in the diff pane). The app builds, and all 20 tests pass.
- Nothing else was changed, and nothing is committed.

**What's left for step 6** (same list as before):
- `App.tsx`:
  - remove the "Integration TODO" box and the placeholder header text
  - pass the new optional settings to the forms and the book list (saving, success and error messages, loading)
  - block a second submit while one is still saving
- `App.css`: make the View Details button visible and style the genre and date labels.
- `api.ts`: show a friendlier message when the backend can't be reached.
- Make the checkout form's Book dropdown list every book, not just the filtered ones.

If you make those changes yourself, I can still help with other things. I can answer questions about the existing code, explain test failures, run the tests and checks, or move on to step 7. Please note in `AI_USAGE.md` (or your submission) which step 6 parts you wrote yourself.

ive been away for a while, catch me up to pace on whats left in the build
````

#### Assistance and code contribution
- Status summary only. Surveyed the repo (git status/log/diff, and grep for the remaining
  step 6 items in `App.tsx`, `App.css`, and `api.ts`). No files modified other than this log.
- The harness reported that `frontend/src/components/BookForm.tsx` changed on disk since
  the assistant's last read. `git diff --stat` still shows the same +97 lines as in
  Turn 44, so there was no visible content change. The cause is not determined.

#### Verification
- Executed `git status --short` and `git log --oneline -5`: steps 1–5 committed (latest
  `79a3a5d app wiring`). The four component files from Turn 43 are uncommitted.
- Executed grep: the "Integration TODO" card and placeholder text are still in `App.tsx`,
  there are no new style rules in `App.css`, and there is no friendly network error in
  `api.ts`.
- Executed `pytest -q backend/tests`: 12 passed. `python scripts/check_readiness.py`:
  `ready=true`. `npx.cmd jest`: 20 passed.

#### Assistant response — verbatim
`````markdown
Welcome back. Here's where the build stands. I checked the repo just now.

### Done and committed (steps 1–5)
| Step | What | Commit |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Backend foundation (tables, DB sessions) | `backend foundation done` |
| 2 | Book endpoints | `book endpoints done` |
| 3 | Checkout endpoints, plus search trimming and the patron-name limit | `check endpoints done` |
| 4 | Frontend API layer (`api.ts`) | `frontend api layer` |
| 5 | App wiring (`App.tsx`) | `app wiring` |

Current checks all pass: backend **12/12**, frontend **20/20**, and `check_readiness.py` reports **`ready=true`**. So the app already meets the graded requirements.

### Step 6 (UX polish): partly done, not committed
- **Done (on disk):** form validation, plus empty-list and "no checkouts" messages, in the 4 component files.
- **Left for you to write.** I can't continue this part, because it was stopped by the safety classifier.
  - `App.tsx`:
    - remove the "Integration TODO" box, the "(TODO API)" button, and the placeholder header text
    - pass the new settings to the components (saving state, success and error messages, loading)
    - block double-submits
  - `App.css`: make the **View Details** button visible and style the genre and date labels.
  - `api.ts`: show a friendlier message than "Failed to fetch."
  - Make the checkout **Book** dropdown list all books.

### Step 7: not started
- Run with Docker and Postgres (`docker compose up --build`, then `smoke-test.sh`). Docker isn't installed on this machine, so this needs Docker Desktop or relying on CI.
- Push, confirm the CI **Grade** shows PASS, and open the PR.
- Add the submission summary to `AI_USAGE.md`. I can do that when you ask me to prepare the submission.

**Housekeeping:** commit the step 6 component changes when you're happy with them, but don't commit `backend/libraryconnect.db`. Also, note in the log which step 6 parts you write yourself.

#### Assistance and code contribution
- Instructions only, for restarting the local dev servers. No files modified other than
  this log. No servers were started by the assistant.

#### Verification
- Executed `curl` checks: ports 8000 and 5173 were not responding (servers down).
- Executed `ls -d backend/.venv frontend/node_modules`: both exist.

#### Assistant response — verbatim
`````markdown
Both servers are currently off. Everything is still installed (`backend\.venv` and `frontend\node_modules` exist), so you only need to start them. Use **two PowerShell windows**.

**Window 1: backend**
```powershell
cd C:\Users\kevin\OneDrive\Desktop\blueprint-challenge-kc\backend
```
```powershell
.venv\Scripts\python -m uvicorn app:app --reload
```
Wait for `Application startup complete.`

**Window 2: frontend**
```powershell
cd C:\Users\kevin\OneDrive\Desktop\blueprint-challenge-kc\frontend
```
```powershell
npm.cmd run dev
```

Then open **http://localhost:5173** in Edge. Your earlier books are still there.

When you're done, press **Ctrl+C** in each window. Start only **one** backend at a time, so you don't end up with two again.

#### Assistance and code contribution
- Review only, as requested ("dont make any changes"). No application files modified.
- **Observed applicant edits** (the applicant states they made these step 6 changes):
  - `frontend/src/App.css`: +92 lines (list row layout, `.list button.secondary`, `.tag`,
    `.form-grid`, `.form-actions`, `.field-error`, `.success`, `.muted`, `.details`,
    `button:disabled`).
  - `frontend/src/App.tsx`: new state (`booksLoading`, `bookSubmitting`, `bookSuccess`,
    `bookError`, `checkoutSubmitting`, `checkoutSuccess`, `checkoutError`, `allBooks`); refs
    `bookSubmittingRef` and `checkoutSubmittingRef`; a loading flag in the book-list effect;
    a new unfiltered `allBooks` effect; per-form success/error handling; props passed to
    `BookList`, `BookForm`, and `CheckoutForm`; the TODO card heading emptied and the
    button renamed "Load Books".
  - The four component files still show the same diff sizes as the Turn 43 assistant
    changes. The harness reported `BookForm.tsx` changed on disk, but no content
    difference from Turn 43 was identified.
- Findings: (1) `errormessage` prop typo (blocking), (2) unused `checkoutSubmittingRef`
  (blocking for tsc/ESLint), (3) the TODO card and placeholder header are only partly
  removed (empty `<h2>`), plus minor nits. Did not give the go-ahead to commit.

#### Verification
- Executed `git status --short`, `git diff --stat`, and `git diff` of `App.tsx`, `App.css`,
  `api.ts`, and `index.html` (`api.ts` and `index.html` unchanged).
- Executed `npx.cmd tsc -b`: exit 2. TS6133 unused `checkoutSubmittingRef` (App.tsx:52);
  TS2322 `errormessage` not a prop of `BookForm` (App.tsx:193).
- Executed `npx.cmd eslint .`: exit 1, 1 error (unused `checkoutSubmittingRef`).
- Executed `npx.cmd jest`: Test Suites 1 failed, 2 passed. `src/App.test.tsx` failed to run
  (TS2322 at App.tsx:193); 13 of 13 remaining tests passed.

#### Assistant response — verbatim
`````markdown
**Not yet. Two small fixes first.** I didn't change anything. Right now the App test file can't even run, which would make CI fail.

### Must fix before committing
1. **Typo in `App.tsx` line 193:** `errormessage={bookError}` should be **`errorMessage`** (capital M).
   - TypeScript rejects the unknown prop. That breaks the build and stops all 7 `App.test.tsx` tests from running: Jest showed **13 passed instead of 20**.
   - It also means book-creation errors would never be displayed.
2. **Unused `checkoutSubmittingRef` (line 52):** it's declared but never used, and both `tsc` and ESLint fail on that.
   - Either use it in `handleCreateCheckout` the same way `bookSubmittingRef` is used in `handleCreateBook`, which gives checkouts the same double-submit guard, or delete the line.
   - I'd use it, for consistency.

### Should fix (not breaking, but step 6 isn't finished without it)
3. **The TODO card is only half-removed.** The `<h2>` is now **empty**, which screen readers announce as a blank heading. The card still says *"Route handlers, form wiring, and API calls are intentionally left as TODOs for the team."* (line 170). The header still says *"Starter frontend scaffold with TODOs for API integration."* (line 162).
   - Suggestion: delete the whole card. The list already loads automatically, and the tests work without the Load Books button. Then you can remove `handleLoadBooks` too.
   - Replace the header line with something like "Manage the catalog and record checkouts."

### Looks good ✅
- **CSS:** fixes the invisible View Details button, styles the genre and date tags, and adds form, error, success, and disabled-button styles. Nice.
- **Per-form success and error messages,** cleared when the user edits the form again.
- **Book double-submit guard** using a ref plus a disabled button.
- **Separate unfiltered `allBooks` list** for the checkout dropdown, which fixes the quirk I mentioned.
- **Loading state** passed to `BookList`.
- Skipping the "Failed to fetch" wording is fine. It's optional polish.

**Nitpicks (optional):** "checkoutddropdown" typo in a comment, `App.css` has no newline at the end, and the removed comment *"Ignore responses for an older search…"* explained the `ignore` flag. It could be worth keeping.

After fixing 1 and 2, run these from `frontend`:

```powershell
npx.cmd tsc -b
```

```powershell
npx.cmd jest
```

You want no `tsc` output and **20 passed**. Tell me when it's done and I'll re-check before you commit. Also add a note in `AI_USAGE.md` that you wrote these step 6 changes in `App.tsx` and `App.css`.

````text
alright check again they should be fixed
````

#### Assistance and code contribution
- Re-review only. No application files modified.
- **Observed applicant edits since Turn 48** in `frontend/src/App.tsx`: `errormessage` is
  corrected (tsc passes); `checkoutSubmittingRef` is now checked and set in
  `handleCreateCheckout` but never reset; the TODO card `<h2>` was removed (its paragraph
  and the Load Books button remain); the header placeholder text was replaced by an empty
  `<p></p>`.
- Finding: the checkout ref is never reset to `false`, so every checkout after the first
  is silently ignored (blocking). Did not give the go-ahead to commit yet.
- Logging incident: the first write of this entry failed with `OSError: [Errno 22]
  Invalid argument: 'AI_USAGE.md'` (likely a transient OneDrive file lock). The retry
  succeeded. The file was verified intact (Turns 1–49 present, and `git diff --stat`
  shows only insertions).

#### Verification
- Executed from `frontend/`: `npx.cmd tsc -b` exit 0; `npx.cmd eslint .` exit 0;
  `npx.cmd jest`: 3 suites passed, 20 tests passed.
- Executed `python scripts/check_readiness.py`: `ready=true`. Executed backend pytest:
  12 passed.
- Executed `grep checkoutSubmittingRef frontend/src/App.tsx`: only lines 52 (declaration),
  138 (check), and 139 (set to true). There is no reset, which confirms the bug by reading
  the code. It was not reproduced in the browser.

#### Assistant response — verbatim
`````markdown
Both fixes worked: `tsc` and ESLint pass, frontend **20/20**, backend **12/12**, and `ready=true`. **But one new bug needs fixing before you commit.** I didn't change anything.

### Must fix: checkouts stop working after the first one
In `handleCreateCheckout`, `checkoutSubmittingRef.current` is set to `true` but **never set back to `false`**. After the first checkout, the guard at the top returns early forever. Clicking **Create Checkout** again silently does nothing until the page is reloaded. The tests don't catch it because each test only creates one checkout.

Fix: add one line to its `finally`, matching `handleCreateBook`:

```tsx
} finally {
  checkoutSubmittingRef.current = false
  setCheckoutSubmitting(false)
}
```

### Should fix (still leftover from before)
- The header now has an **empty** `<p></p>`. Either delete it or add a line such as "Manage the catalog and record checkouts."
- The old TODO card is still there without its heading. It still shows *"Route handlers, form wiring, and API calls are intentionally left as TODOs for the team."* and the Load Books button. I'd delete the whole `<section className="card">…</section>` block, plus `handleLoadBooks`, since nothing else uses it. The tests pass without the button.

After that, rerun from `frontend`:

```powershell
npx.cmd tsc -b
```

```powershell
npx.cmd jest
```

Then **add a second checkout in the real app** to confirm the fix. If both look good, you're clear to commit. Commit the 6 frontend files and `AI_USAGE.md`, not `libraryconnect.db`. Remember to add your note in `AI_USAGE.md` that you wrote the `App.tsx` and `App.css` step 6 changes.

(Logging note: my first write to `AI_USAGE.md` this turn failed with a file error, probably a brief OneDrive lock. The retry worked, and I checked that the log is intact: Turns 1–49, nothing lost.)

The applicant states that they wrote the following step 6 changes themselves, after the
assistant's Turn 43 work was stopped by a safety classifier and the assistant declined to
continue it in Turn 45. The assistant reviewed these changes (Turns 48–50) but did not
write or edit them.
- `frontend/src/App.tsx`: the `booksLoading`, `bookSubmitting`/`bookSuccess`/`bookError`,
  `checkoutSubmitting`/`checkoutSuccess`/`checkoutError`, and `allBooks` state; the
  `bookSubmittingRef`/`checkoutSubmittingRef` double-submit guards; the loading flag in the
  book-list effect; the unfiltered `allBooks` effect for the checkout dropdown; per-form
  success and error messages; passing the new props to `BookList`, `BookForm`, and
  `CheckoutForm`; the new header text "Manage the catalog and record checkouts"; and
  removing the TODO card's heading and text (a card with a "Load Books" button remains).
  Also the fixes made after review: the `errorMessage` prop typo, using
  `checkoutSubmittingRef`, and resetting it in `finally`.
- `frontend/src/App.css`: all styles added after the original rules (list row layout,
  visible View Details button, `.tag`, form layout, field error/success/muted text,
  details grid, disabled buttons).
- The friendlier "Failed to fetch" message was intentionally skipped by the applicant.
- The four component files (`BookForm.tsx`, `CheckoutForm.tsx`, `BookList.tsx`,
  `BookDetail.tsx`) contain the assistant's Turn 43 changes. No applicant changes were
  identified in them.
